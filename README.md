---

inkread is a document reader and writing platform for tablet-class **e-ink** devices, targeting the
**Supernote** (Ratta, RK3566, Android 11) first. A Kotlin/Android shell wraps a Rust `cdylib` (over
JNI) that owns parsing, layout, rendering, the refresh policy, and the **ink model** — so the hard
parts are memory-safe, vendor-neutral, and testable on your laptop with no device.

>inkRead is an open-source e-ink reader for Supernote that combines serious PDF/EPUB reading with
>handwriting-first annotation. It uses a Kotlin Android shell around a Rust core for parsing, layout, rendering,
>ink, dictionaries, and refresh policy. The goal is simple: portable reading, portable annotations, and no cloud dependency.

## Why inkread?

On e-ink today you usually pick one of two compromises:

- **KOReader** reads beautifully and has a huge plugin ecosystem — but it's reading-first; handwriting
  on documents is an afterthought.
- **Supernote's built-in reader** writes beautifully on native hardware — but it's closed, locks your
  annotations into a proprietary format, and the document-reading features (reflow, dictionary,
  plugins) are thin.

inkread aims at the **gap between them**: real reading *and* real handwriting, with your annotations
**written back into the PDF** (editable or flattened) so they're portable to any other app — all on
an open [AGPL-3.0](./LICENSE) Rust core you can audit and extend.

  ## Features

  **Reading**
  - Reads **PDF**, **EPUB**, **CBZ** (comics/manga), and **plain text** — files are detected by
    content, not just their extension
  - **Reflowable reading for both PDF and EPUB** — flip Reflow on and the text re-wraps to your
    screen instead of pinch-zooming a fixed layout
  - **Choose a font family** from bundled open-source faces (serif / sans / mono)
  - Adjustable **font size** (60%–300%), **line spacing**, and **alignment**
  - **Swipe** or tap the page edge to turn pages
  - Pinch-to-zoom with a page navigator (minimap + zoom controls)
  - Table of contents navigation with **in-chapter reading progress**
  - Bookmarks and go-to-page
  - **Reflow-stable resume** — reopens exactly where you left off, even after a font/size change
  - Display controls: rotate, crop, **contrast**, margins, **night mode**, and quick **reading-style presets**

  **InkRead Daily** — your reading companion
  - A clean **daily issue** compiled from your **RSS feeds, blogs, and read-later** sources
  - **Compiled automatically every day, on device** — the first build takes a few seconds while it
    pulls from **10 preloaded sources**; **add your own** or **disable** any of the pre-seeded ones
  - Front-page headlines with **read / unread** tracking and readable article extraction (just the prose)

  **Handwriting & annotation**
  - Floating tool palette that opens as a collapsed **inkwell puck** — drag to move, tap to expand
  - Pen — write directly on the page with the stylus
  - Highlighter
  - Four ink colours (black, blue, red, green), switchable in-window
  - Adjustable stroke thickness
  - Eraser
  - Lasso select — circle ink or text to move, copy, delete, or look up
  - **Annotations list** — every handwritten note in one place; tap to jump to it
  - Undo / redo

  **Text tools**
  - Full-text search with jump-between-matches
  - Dictionary lookup with thesaurus
  - Add your own custom dictionaries (drop a starter dictionary into `MYSTYLES/SnDict/<name>` and install it in-app)
  - Send a multi-line selection to the **Supernote Digest**

  **Export & data**
  - Export annotations as a PDF into a synced folder
  - Overwrite the original PDF in place, or save a separate `-annotated` copy
  - Offline-first — no network unless explicitly enabled

  **Fast & native**
  - A **cache-based pagination engine** with **next-page read-ahead** keeps page turns quick on e-ink
  - Built for the Supernote family (RK3566, Android 11)
  - Kotlin/Android shell + a Rust core (over JNI) that owns parsing, layout, rendering, the refresh policy, and the ink model
  - Licensed under **AGPL-3.0**

  >Custom Dictionaries:
  >>- The custom-dictionary path follows my [SnDictionary](https://github.com/j-raghavan/sn-dictionary) Plugin.
  >>- Place your stardict file in (MYSTYLES/SnDict/<name>) and it will show up when you want to install it as custom dictionary. 
  

## How it compares

| | **inkread** | **KOReader** | **Supernote reader** |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Handwriting on documents | **First-class** (core ink model) | Minimal | **First-class** |
| Annotation portability | **Written into the PDF** + portable sidecar | Sidecar metadata | Proprietary, locked-in |
| Document reading (PDF reflow, dictionary) | Yes | **Mature** | Limited |
| Daily reading companion (RSS → on-device issue) | **Built-in** (InkRead Daily) | Plugin (NewsDownloader) | No |
| E-ink refresh control | Vendor-neutral policy in core ([platform-capped](./docs/EINK-LIMITS.md)) | **Excellent** (on devices that allow it) | Native / vendor-optimal |
| Extensibility | Native Lua API + selected KOReader-shim | **Huge Lua ecosystem** | None (closed) |
| Architecture | Rust core, host-testable | C + Lua | Closed-source |
| Open source | **AGPL-3.0** | **AGPL-3.0** | Proprietary |
| Devices | Supernote family (RK3566) | **Broad** (Kindle/Kobo/Android…) | Supernote only |

> Honest take: KOReader is the more mature *reader* and runs on far more hardware; the Supernote
> reader is the more polished *native* experience. inkread is the **only one of the three that's both
> open and built handwriting-first**, and at **v1.0 it's a daily driver** — see status below. Pen
> latency rides the firmware's own sub-frame ink path; refresh tuning is capped by what the platform
> exposes to sideloaded apps — [docs/EINK-LIMITS.md](./docs/EINK-LIMITS.md) states those limits plainly.

inkread is **not** a KOReader clone. KOReader is prior art and compatibility inspiration; inkread
reuses its plugin *style* (a selected `.koplugin` shim) but ships its own Rust-native engine.

## Status

**v1.0 — stable.** The Rust workspace (parse · reflow · ink · refresh policy · dictionary · Lua
runtime) builds and tests green on the host, **and the app runs on the Supernote**
(Manta / Nomad / A5X / A6X): reading, reflow, handwriting, dictionary, export, and **InkRead Daily**
all work on-device. The document formats and the on-disk annotation sidecars are stable; further
work (a broader Lua plugin API, more formats, additional devices) lands additively.

## Quick start

The entire Rust core builds **on your machine with no Android SDK** — that's a hard design rule:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/j-raghavan/inkread.git
cd inkread
cargo test --workspace      # green with no device, no Android toolchain
```

Build & sideload the Android APK (needs JDK 17–21, the Android NDK, and `cargo-ndk`):

```bash
./buildApk.sh              # cargo-ndk → pdfium → dictionary → Gradle assemble
./buildApk.sh --install    # ...and adb install to a connected Supernote
```

Prebuilt APKs are attached to each [GitHub Release](https://github.com/j-raghavan/inkread/releases).

## Using inkread

Open a document from the **home screen** (*Open a Document*, or pick up where you left off
from the *Continue reading* card) — **PDF, EPUB, CBZ, and plain text** are supported. Or tap the
**InkRead Daily** card to read today's auto-compiled issue. Your reading position, ink, and per-book
settings are saved automatically and restored when you reopen.

Two surfaces drive everything: a **bottom control bar** (tap the centre of the page) and a
**floating tool palette** that sits as a small **inkwell puck** on the page (drag it to move, tap to
expand the tools, tap again to collapse).

### InkRead Daily

A calm daily reading companion that turns your feeds into a single e-ink issue — built on device,
no cloud.

- Open the **InkRead Daily** card on the home screen. It **compiles a fresh issue automatically each
  day**; the **first build takes a few seconds** while it fetches and lays out your sources.
- Out of the box it pulls from **10 preloaded sources**. Open **Daily → Sources** to **add your own**
  (RSS / Atom / blog URL) or **disable** any of the pre-seeded ones.
- The front page lists headlines with **read / unread** marks; tap one to read the cleaned-up article
  (just the prose), with all the usual reading controls below.

### Reading & navigation

| Action | How |
|---|---|
| Turn page | **Swipe** left/right, or tap the **left third** (back) / **right third** (forward) |
| Reflow a PDF/EPUB | Centre-tap → **Adjust → Page → Reflow: On** — text re-wraps to your screen and font settings |
| Jump to a page | Centre-tap → drag the **slider**, or tap the page number to type one |
| Table of contents | Centre-tap → **Contents** → tap an entry to jump; your in-chapter progress shows on the bar |
| Bookmark a page | Tap the **top-right corner** (dog-ear); list them via **Marks** |
| Zoom & pan | **Pinch** — or **double-tap the centre** — to zoom toward a point; **double-tap again** to restore fit. A minimap (top-right) shows your viewport; while zoomed, edge taps still turn pages. Fit/zoom presets also under **Adjust → Zoom** |

### Search & dictionary

- **Search** — centre-tap → **Search**, type a query, and step hit-to-hit. Matches are
  highlighted on the page. On-device, works offline.
- **Dictionary** — **long-press a word** with the stylus, or pick the **Define** tool and tap.
  Looks up an installed offline dictionary first, with an opt-in Wiktionary fallback. Install or
  remove dictionaries from the lookup card.

### Handwriting & annotation tools

Pick a tool from the floating palette. Tap a tool again to reveal its options (e.g. colours).
**Undo/Redo** sit on the palette.

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Pen** | Write directly on the page with low-latency e-ink ink. Strokes bake into the page and persist. |
| **Highlighter** | Lay down a wide translucent band; multiple colours. |
| **Eraser** | Drag across strokes to remove them. |
| **Lasso** | Draw a loop around your writing to select it. A floating toolbar then offers **move, cut, copy, paste, delete, select-all**, and **Add to Digest**. (Loop over printed text instead and it selects the text.) |
| **Define** | Tap a word to look it up, or drag to select text for **Copy / Define / Highlight / Add to Digest**. |

Ink is saved to a sidecar next to your document and re-loaded next time. Centre-tap → **Notes** opens
the **annotations list** — every handwritten note across the book in one place; tap one to jump
straight to its page.

### Saving your work elsewhere

- **Export to PDF** — centre-tap → **Export**. Choose **editable annotations** (portable to
  Preview, Adobe, etc.) or **flattened** (baked in, visible in any viewer). Written beside the
  original file.
- **Add to Digest** — from a lasso or text selection, push the selected text (with its page) into
  the Supernote **Digest** app.

### Display & layout

Centre-tap → **Adjust** opens a tabbed sheet, remembered per book:

| Tab | Controls |
|---|---|
| **Rotate** | Screen orientation — **0° / 90° / 180° / 270°** (portrait, landscape, and both flips) |
| **Font** | **Typeface** — pick a bundled font family (serif / sans / mono); **Text size** — A− / A+ steppers plus **100%** (default) and **XL** presets, 60%–300% (reflowable books) |
| **Page** | **Reflow** on/off, line spacing + alignment (reflowable books) |
| **Zoom** | Fit mode + zoom level |
| **Crop** | Auto-crop white margins + margin size |
| **Display** | Contrast / display enhancement, **night mode** (inverted), and **reading-style presets** |

> **On the roadmap:** Lua plugins and cross-document search are in the core or specified but not yet
> exposed in the shipped app — see [Status](#status).

## Architecture

```
app/  (Kotlin/Android shell)  ──JNI──▶  reader-core/  (Rust cdylib, libreader.so)
  UI · EPD adapter · pen/touch          parse · layout · render · refresh policy · ink
  speaks vendor waveforms               speaks RefreshIntent — never names a vendor (IR-7)
```

The core never names a vendor and never leaks Android types — device specifics live in the Kotlin
adapter and the feature-gated JNI bridge. Supporting crates: `inkread-pdftext`, `inkread-epub`,
`inkread-ink`, `inkread-dict`, `inkread-lua`, and the vendor-neutral `device-eink`.

## About & disclaimer

inkread is an **independent, community project** built by a Supernote Manta owner and fan. It exists
because the itch was personal — I wanted reading and handwriting to work *together* on my own device,
the way I needed them to, and built the reader I wished existed. 

I did try KOReader and i felt it was little sluggish on my Supernote Manta. Having developed a few
plugins for Supernote, i took the plunge to create this. In no way or shape this is a replacement for
the KOReader, this is more of a custom app for the Awesome Supernote Device!
